[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mscript[0m makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is[m
     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session[m
     as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out[m
     later with lpr(1).[m
[m
     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no[m
     file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
     Options:[m
[m
     [1m-a,[0m [1m--append[0m[m
             Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior con‐[m
             tents.[m

[7m Manual page script(1) line 2 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K             Run the [4mcommand[24m rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it[m
             easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves[m
             differently when its stdout is not a tty.[m
[m
     [1m-e,[0m [1m--return[0m[m
             Return the exit code of the child process.  Uses the same format[m
             as bash termination on signal termination exit code is 128+n.[m
[m
     [1m-f,[0m [1m--flush[0m[m
             Flush output after each write.  This is nice for telecooperation:[m
             one person does `mkfifo foo; script -f foo', and another can[m
             supervise real-time what is being done using `cat foo'.[m
[m
     [1m--force[0m[m
             Allow the default output destination, i.e. the typescript file,[m
             to be a hard or symbolic link.  The command will follow a sym‐[m
             bolic link.[m

             field indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.[m
             The second field indicates how many characters were output this[m
             time.  This information can be used to replay typescripts with[m
             realistic typing and output delays.[m

     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a [4mcontrol-D[24m to exit the[m
